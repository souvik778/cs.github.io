I tried to keep my webpage simple and interactive just using Html, CSS and Java Script.
Recommended to view in full screen mode, as resolutions not calibarated.
Features used other than basic are:

•	Use of marquee.

•	Use of footer.

•	Feedback button and its functionality, using Java Script.

•	Inserting video elements using <iframe> and <video> element.

•	Use of nav bar

•	Use of flex box

•	Use of position element

•	Have css for small and medium screen for mobile compatibility without use of any third party addons like bootstrap.

•	Use of dropdown content
